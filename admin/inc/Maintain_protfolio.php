            <h2>Maintain your portfolio</h2>
            <p>A portfolio is a living document. It evolves over time, in the same manner and pace that a young professional progresses. It is a personal reflection of who you are and you can use it in your job search, during the interview, and even when you get employed at your performance review.

                Keep in mind that you should be featuring newer work as your skills and experience progress over time. It gives you a starting point to grow from and provides you with visual feedback on how far youâ€™ve come along since you first started. It can be quite encouraging. </p>           </div>
